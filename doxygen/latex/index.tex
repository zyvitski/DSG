The Digital Signal Generation Project or \hyperlink{namespace_d_s_g}{D\+S\+G} is a collection of tools used for the generation of digital signals, more specifically the generation of band-\/limited waveforms. \hypertarget{index_Scope}{}\subsection{Scope}\label{index_Scope}
Though \hyperlink{namespace_d_s_g}{D\+S\+G} has a focus on Bandlimited Waveform Generation it is not limited to it. \hyperlink{namespace_d_s_g}{D\+S\+G} defines a signal processing interface that is compatable with any form fo audio based signal processing work. The interface defined in \hyperlink{class_d_s_g_1_1_signal_process}{D\+S\+G\+::\+Signal\+Process} is the base interface for signal processing in \hyperlink{namespace_d_s_g}{D\+S\+G}, It is further expanded by \hyperlink{class_d_s_g_1_1_signal_generator}{D\+S\+G\+::\+Signal\+Generator} which adds functionality geared towards waveform generation. See the doumentation for each for their specifics. \hypertarget{index_License}{}\section{License}\label{index_License}
